For custom integrations, use our REST API and webhook system to build powerful automation workflows.

<CodeGroup tabs="Webhook Setup,API Example">
  ````json
  {
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
    "events": ["document.created", "document.updated"],
    "secret": "your_webhook_secret"
  }
  ````
  ````python
import requests

# Create document via API
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.wizium.com/v1/documents",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"},
    json={
        "title": "New Integration Guide",
        "content": "Detailed setup instructions...",
        "tags": ["integration", "api"]
    }
)
print(f"Created document: {response.json()['id']}")
  ````
</CodeGroup>

## Integration Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to ensure reliable and maintainable integrations:

- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Use webhooks for real-time updates instead of polling
- Validate API responses and handle rate limits
- Store API keys securely using environment variables
- Monitor integration health with logging and alerts

<Expandable title="Security Considerations" default-open="false">
  Always use HTTPS for webhook endpoints, validate webhook signatures, and rotate API keys regularly. Never commit secrets to version control.
</Expandable>

## Troubleshooting Integrations

Common integration issues and their solutions:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Webhook not firing | Check URL accessibility and SSL certificate |
| API authentication fails | Verify API key and permissions |
| Sync delays | Review rate limits and retry policies |
| Data inconsistencies | Implement checksums or version tracking |
